                <img src="{% static 'images/Author.jpg'%}" alt="Author :3">
                <p><b>Hi! Im Jade, a teenage author who writes about love and Murder!</b></p>
                <p>I started writing back in primary school as a hoby, I didnt know computers could
                    be used and didnt have access to one so I wrote my own childrens books on paper by hand.
                    I could give my sisters these books but they werent very good due to my lack of planning (Or spelling ability)
                </p>
                <p>I fell inlove with reading in high school, often planning my own stories I wanted to write and 
                    even started off with a small catalog of privated novels on Wattpad (Mostly horror and murder mystery)
                </p>
                <p>At 15 I decided to write my first book, Enchanted Roses and as of now Im still working on it. 
                    The goal of this website is to log my progress and get potential beta readers to help me out!

                <h3>Enchanted roses (Nov 2025)</h3>
                <h5>Romance, Murder mystery, Royalty Novel</h5>
                    <p>
                        In a kingdom still healing from centuries of war, <strong>Princess Salem</strong> prepares to ascend the throne of Valenthea. 
                        But just as peace seems within reach, an unexpected letter arrives — unsigned, poetic, and accompanied by a single rose.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When her childhood friend and royal knight, <strong>Hunter Whitewood</strong>, returns from the frontlines, Salem enlists his help to uncover the identity of her secret admirer. 
                        What begins as a light-hearted search soon takes a darker turn as a string of murders rocks the palace — each victim marked with the symbol of a fox.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As Hunter investigates the growing threat of the elusive <strong>Fox Killer</strong>, he must also confront his feelings for Salem — feelings he’s buried for years beneath armor and duty. 
                        Every clue pulls them closer, not only to the killer, but to each other.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em>Enchanted Roses</em> is a tale of royal secrets, forbidden love, and a mystery that could cost the crown. 
                        In a court of masks and daggers, trust is fragile — and love might be the most dangerous risk of all.
                    </p>
                <h6>First book in the enchanted series</h6>

                <h3>Enchanted Thorns (Dec 2026)</h3>
                <h5>War story, Romance, Tragedy, Wuh luh wuh</h5>
                    <p>
                        In a war-torn corner of the world, <strong>Mary Whitewood</strong> fights for the freedom of her people — a soldier hardened by loss, loyalty, and the haunting memory of her fallen parents. 
                        Serving in the <strong>Valenthean Military</strong>, she’s known for her quiet bravery and fierce devotion to her older brother, Hunter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As the <strong>Valenthean-Nazerian War</strong> rages into its tenth year, a young medic named <strong>Evelyn Raye</strong> is assigned to Mary’s unit. 
                        Compassionate, defiant, and entirely unexpected, Evelyn begins to chip away at the walls Mary has built around her heart.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What begins as guarded camaraderie slowly unfolds into something deeper — something dangerous in a time when love is a luxury no soldier can afford. 
                        As battles intensify and casualties mount, Mary is forced to choose between vengeance and vulnerability, between duty and desire.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em>Enchanted Thorns</em> is a story of resistance, sacrifice, and forbidden love — and how even in the darkest moments, a single connection can spark light. 
                        But war demands everything… and not every story ends in survival.
                    </p>
